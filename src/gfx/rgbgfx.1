.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rgbgfx

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program converts PNG images into the Nintendo Game Boy's planar tile format.
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D
Debug features are enabled.
.It Fl f
Fix the input PNG file to be a correctly indexed image.
.It Fl F
Same as
.Fl f ,
but additionally, the input PNG file is fixed to have its parameters match the
command line's parameters.
.It Fl d Ar depth
The bitdepth of the output image (either 1 or 2).
By default, the bitdepth is 2 (two bits per pixel).
.It Fl h
Lay out tiles horizontally rather than vertically.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
The name of the output file.
.It Fl p Ar palfile
Raw bytes (8 bytes for two bits per pixel, 4 bytes for one bit per pixel)
containing the RGB15 values in the little-endian byte order and then ordered
from lightest to darkest.
.It Fl P
Same as
.Fl p ,
but the pallete file output name is made by taking the input filename,
removing the file extension, and appending
.Pa .pal .
.It Fl t Ar mapfile
If any tiles are the same, don't place the repeat tiles in the output file, and
make a tilemap file.
.It Fl T
Same as
.Fl t ,
but the tilemap file output name is made by taking the input filename,
removing the file extension, and appending
.Pa .tilemap .
.It Fl v
Verbose.
Print errors when the command line parameters and the parameters in
the PNG file don't match.
.It Fl x Ar tiles
Trim the end of the output file by this many tiles.

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following will take a PNG file with a bitdepth of 1, 2, or 8, and output
planar 2bpp data:
.Pp
.D1 $ rgbgfx -o out.2bpp in.png
.Pp
The following will do nothing:
.Pp
.D1 $ rgbgfx in.png
