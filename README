RGBDS (Rednex Game Boy Development System) is a free assembler/linker package
for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. It consists of:

  - rgbasm  (assembler)
  - rgblink (linker)
  - rgbfix  (checksum/header fixer)

rgbgfx is a program which converts PNG images into the Game Boy's planar tile
format, for eventual integration into RGBDS.
